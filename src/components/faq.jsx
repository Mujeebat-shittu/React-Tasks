            question: "What is React?",
            answer: "React is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It lets developers build reusable UI components."
  },
  {
      question: "What is a component in React?",
      answer: "A component is a reusable piece of UI that can have its own logic and state. Components can be functions or classes."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between state and props?",
    answer: "State is data managed inside a component that can change over time, while props are values passed from a parent component to a child component."
  },
  {
      question: "What is JSX?",
    answer: "JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows you to write HTML-like code in JavaScript, which React then compiles into real DOM elements."
},
{
    question: "What does useState do in React?",
    answer: "useState is a React hook that allows a component to hold and update internal state."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a closure in JavaScript?",
    answer: "A closure is a function that remembers variables from its outer scope, even after that outer function has finished executing."
},
  {
      question: "What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?",
    answer: "== checks for value equality and allows type coercion. === checks for both value and type equality â€” it's stricter and more reliable."
},
  {
      question: "What is an API?",
    answer: "An API (Application Programming Interface) allows different software systems to communicate. In web development, it's often used to send and receive data from servers."
  },
  {
      question: "What is a function in programming?",
      answer: "A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. It can be reused, takes inputs (parameters), and can return an output."
  },
  {
    question: "What is conditional rendering in React?",
    answer: "Conditional rendering means displaying certain parts of the UI only when specific conditions are met, like showing a message only if the user is logged in."
